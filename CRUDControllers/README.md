## Vapor 3 Series I - CRUD with Controllers
As an iOS developer, I am super excited that Apple made Swift open-sourced in 2015.
Not only does it mean there will be more interesting features, but we are able to run Swift on Linux machines as well.
More importantly, the later one brings us the possibility to make a server with Swift.
Currently, there are couple of different server side Swift frameworks, such as Vapor, Perfect, and Kitura.
The reason why I choose Vapor 3 for this article is that it's the only framework which supports [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) at this moment.
As a result, Vapor 3 provides fully asynchronous APIs and it's a very good chance for me to understand asynchronous programming.
