## Vapor 3 Series III - Testing
In [our previous article](https://medium.com/swift2go/vapor-3-series-ii-authentication-ff17847a9659), we implemented two ways to authenticate users: HTTP basic authentication and bearer token authorization.
As a result, our application only accepts requests from authenticated users.
However, we should write some unit tests for our endpoints, even though our application is quite simple.
Testing is an important part of software development, and writing unit tests allows us to develop and evolve our application quickly.
In order to develop new feature quickly, we want to ensure that the existing features don't break, and having a thorough test suite lets us verify everything still works as we change our codebase.
In this article, I am going to demonstrate how to write unit tests for our CRUD endpoints and how to run the tests on Linux machine with Docker.
